# Stay Ahead – Customer Churn Prediction System

An AI-powered churn prediction system for SaaS products, developed as a **Capstone Project** at **Samsung Innovation Campus**.

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for SaaS businesses, where retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques to help businesses take proactive retention actions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior and identify churn patterns  
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models  
- Handle imbalanced datasets using appropriate metrics  
- Deliver a practical end-to-end AI solution  

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost (Final selected model)  
- NODE  
- TabNet  

The final model (**XGBoost**) was selected based on **Recall and F1-score**, prioritizing the detection of high-risk customers.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle – IBM Watson Analytics)  
- **Size:** ~7,000 customer records  
- **Target Variable:** Customer churn (Yes / No)

## 🛠️ Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Handling class imbalance  
6. Model selection  

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Recall
